# Sales & Profitability Dashboard: Distribution Challenge in Pennsylvania

This project explores sales and profitability patterns across U.S. states and cities using Tableau dashboards. By focusing on Pennsylvania, a high-sales but low-profit state, we investigate the possibility of improving profit margins by proposing a new distribution center near Philadelphia.

## Summary
Pennsylvania generates strong sales performance, but a large number of orders result in negative profit. The root cause appears to be the high cost of fulfilling these orders, which often outweighs the revenue generated.

---

## Solution  
A potential solution is to set up a distribution center near Philadelphia. By reducing the cost-to-serve for the region, it's possible to improve the profit margin of Pennsylvania orders and align them with the performance of other high-revenue states.
