### Production Planning

### [Task Scheduling in Manufacturing Workflow Planning](/project3)


The project aims to optimize task scheduling in a manufacturing workflow by applying critical path analysis. By visualizing task dependencies—spanning procurement, assembly, inspection, and shipping—the analysis identifies which processes are time-sensitive and which offer scheduling flexibility. This structure supports efficient cross-department coordination to meet the 16-day production goal for a new product launch.
